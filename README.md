# GradeMaser Alpha
Grademaster is an alternative to apps like GradeWay and GradePro, for desktops. It is a way for students to check their grades and in the future could even give an analysis of their Schoolwork. GradeMaster uses Selenium to scrap HomeAccessCenter's website to pull grades, and sent them to an intuiive deskop app, where the user can view grades & access GPA estimations.
